##What I'm doing now
* Working at [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/)
** I've worked at SFC as the Operations Manager since March 2022. I am passionate about ethical and accessible tech, as well as the right to repair our own devices and software.
* Learning at [University of Tennessee - Knoxville](https://geography.utk.edu/)
** In December 2023, I will graduate from UTK with a B.S. in Geographical Information Science Technology and minor in Geology. After that I hope to get more deeply involved in some open mapping and data projects.
* Having fun at [Knox Makers](knoxmakers.org)
** Knox Makers is one of the biggest community makerspaces in the southeast US and the place I use to get out my creative energy. I also serve on the Board of Directors as the Membership Director and help teach classes in laser cutting and Inkscape.
